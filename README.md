# India Air Quality Index Analysis

This repository contains SQL scripts and documentation for analyzing air quality index (AQI) data in India. The analysis aims to understand patterns, trends, and factors influencing air quality across various regions in the country.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- SQL: We utilized SQL for querying and analyzing air quality data from the database.
  
- Relational Databases: We worked with relational databases to store and manage air quality data efficiently.

- Data Cleaning: Prior to analysis, we performed data cleaning tasks to ensure data integrity and accuracy for analysis purposes.

- Data Aggregation: We aggregated and summarized air quality data to analyze trends and patterns over time and across different regions.

- Statistical Analysis: We applied statistical techniques to derive meaningful insights from the air quality data, including identifying pollutant trends and assessing compliance with regulatory standards.

## Repository Structure

- Scripts: Contains SQL scripts used for data querying, cleaning, aggregation, and analysis.
  
- Documentation: Includes documentation files providing insights into the data analysis process, methodologies, and findings.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the provided SQL scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/india-air-quality-analysis.git`.
  
2. Navigate to the `Scripts` directory to access the SQL scripts.

3. Execute the SQL scripts using your preferred database management tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, SQL Server Management Studio).

4. Refer to the documentation files for detailed insights into the analysis methodologies and findings.
